This is the web application for a startup I created where student groups at my high school created profiles for themselves. Local advertisers were featured on the site, and revenues were
split between the company and the clubs on the site according to level of interaction on their page. Students can also make accounts on the site where they input their interests and receive
recommendations for clubs to join. The company is no longer active, but the web application is still visible [here](https://greenwich.myclubsource.com)
